# `Heliopolis NFT Social Marketplace`

> Heliopolis is a NFT Marketplace that allows users to create, sell and transfer NFT directly via chat.

üöÄ**DEMO:** https://trusty-lock-367505.ts.r.appspot.com/

## Problem

There are various problems with current large NFT Marketplace like OpenSea and Rarible:

+ **Complexity**: Require a lot of steps to create, sell and trade NFTs.
+ **Limitation in creativity**: The opportunities for creators to generate impressive NFTs for users are limitied since they need to have artistic and drawing skills, instead of focusing on their ideas and using state of the art AI models such as Stable Diffusion or DALL-E.
+ **Platform separtion**: Holders have difficulty engaging in the community of their chosen NFT projects since they must use external platforms of communication such as Telegram, Twitter or Discord chat to interact with each other about the NFT projects. These platforms are all separated and isolated, so the users will find it overwhelming to continously switch between different platforms. 


## Solution

Heliopolis NFT Marketplace is built to address those pains of NFT users specifically and for the blockchain enthusiasts in general, with the following innovative features:

### Marketplace
+ **NFT Creation**: Users can create NFTs manually by uploading pictures, or by AIs by entering their prompt ideas
+ **NFT Trading**: Users can freely trade NFTs with each others on the marketplace

### Chat Messaging/Community
+ **Chat Messaging**: Users can create account with their Metamask wallet address and chat with each other directly
+ **Token Transfer**: Users can transfer tokens cross chain with their friends via messaging in the chat
+ **NFT Transfer**: Users can also transfer NFTs with their friends via chat
+ **NFT Gated Chat(Roadmap)**: Uses can join the exclusive group chat of NFTs holders only

## Tech Stack:
+ **Frontend**: Next, React, Typescript, Chakra UI, Moralis Ethereum Boilerplate
+ **Blockchain**: Polygon, Hardhat, Ethers.js, Moralis, IPFS, Infura, Axelar JS SDK
+ **Messaging**: XMTP Protocol
+ **API**: Moralis, Open AI DALL-E API
